# lostworld

**The Lost World: Jurassic Park** (Sega, 1997) statically recompiled — the
game's PowerPC code becomes native C, linked against a Model 3 board.

The board is [model3recomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/model3recomp), carried
here as a submodule. That repository is title-agnostic: nothing in it knows
what game it is running. This repository is the bring-up for one game — the
glue, the pipeline, and the notes on what this particular title needs.

That split is the house style across the sp00nznet recomp projects: one core
toolkit per board, one repository per game. `virtuacop` and `daytonausa` sit
the same way on top of `model2recomp`.

## Status

**Alpha. The game boots and runs as native code. Attract mode is not reached.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Boots from the reset vector | yes |
| Copies itself into RAM and runs from there | yes |
| Completes I/O board init | yes |
| Takes VBlank interrupts | yes |
| Runs SCSI DMA to the Real3D | yes |
| Writes tilemap VRAM | yes |
| Renders those tiles to a framebuffer | yes |
| **Attract mode** | **not yet** |

The 2D tilemap pipeline runs end to end — ROM to lifted C to native execution
to VRAM to pixels — but what the game has drawn so far is its cleared screen.
Attract mode on this title is mostly 3D, and the Real3D renderer is not
written, so that is the gate.

No screenshots of the game yet. There will be some the moment there is
something to show, and not before.

## What you need

- **model3recomp's** prerequisites: CMake 3.20+, a C17 compiler, Python 3.9+,
  optionally SDL2.
- **A Lost World romset you dumped or own.** None is included here, and none
  ever will be. Neither is any recompiled output — that is generated on your
  machine from your dump and is gitignored.

## Getting started

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sp00nznet/lostworld.git
cd lostworld
```

### 1. Build the ROM images

```
python tools/build_roms.py /path/to/lostwsga.zip roms/
```

This works out which chips are the program ROMs by trying interleaves and
checking the result against the PowerPC exception vector table, so it proves
the layout rather than assuming it:

```
program EPROMs : epr-19936.20, epr-19937.19, epr-19938.18, epr-19939.17
maps at        : 0xFFE00000
reset vector   : 0xFFF00100
verified       : 7/7 exception vectors
banked CROM    : roms/lw_bank.bin  (0x2000000 bytes from 16 chips)
VROM           : roms/lw_vrom.bin  (0x4000000 bytes from 16 chips)
```

### 2. Recompile the game

```
python tools/lift.py
```

This boots the machine in an interpreter first, because Model 3 games do not
run from ROM — see [docs/technical/bring-up.md](docs/technical/bring-up.md).
It writes `src/recomp/`, which is **not** committed.

### 3. Build and run

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/lostworld
```

Pass a field count to capture a screenshot and exit, which is what the
conformance runs do:

```
./build/lostworld 600      # writes shot.ppm after 600 fields
```

## When it stops making progress

A recompiled game has no program counter to inspect, so the runtime reports
what it can:

| Symptom | What it means |
|---|---|
| `no function lifted at XXXXXXXX` | an indirect target the lifter missed — collect them and re-run `tools/lift.py --entries` |
| `unimplemented <mn> at XXXXXXXX` | an instruction the lifter does not translate |
| `N device accesses with no field advance` | the guest is polling one register forever; the report names it |
| nothing at all, frames ticking | the guest fell out of lifted code — check `M3_TRACE_CALLS=40` |

the game binary is in this repository, and none ever will be. The tools ship;
the output does not.
